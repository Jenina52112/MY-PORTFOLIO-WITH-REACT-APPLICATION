        <p>Hello! I am Jenina dela Cruz, a current student in UCB Bootcamp for fullStack Web Development.
            I love creating things and solving problems. That's what got me interested in coding. I am also looking 
            on a career switch and aiming for a homebased work which will give me more time to spend with kids.
